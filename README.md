<h3>:snake:About</h3>
<p>By now I'm sure we all know what Snake is and how to play, the game has been around for what seems like forever. Developed by many and played by even more this project was a rainy day activity.</p>

<br />

<h3>:scroll:Gameplay</h3>
<p>Maneuver the turquoise serpent across the board in search of rainbow orbs. Each rainbow orb the serpent eats helps him grow a little bit more and will increase your score by +1. Just be sure to stay on the map and keep track of where you've been, going off the map or biting your own tail will bring the game to an end. Good luck out there and have fun!</p>
